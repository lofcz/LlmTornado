[vector database] = "Pinecone"
Write a C# class named [vector database]VectorDatabase that implements the `LlmTornado.VectorDatabases.IVectorDatabase` interface. This class should serve as a connector to the [vector database] vector store. Implement all required interface methods (for example, methods to create/delete collections, insert vectors or documents, and perform similarity search). 

If an official .NET client or library exists for [vector database], include it and use it to implement these methods; otherwise write a minimal client (for example using HTTP/REST calls) to connect to [vector database] and satisfy the interface requirements. Ensure your code is modular and extensible, with proper constructors and error handling. 

For guidance, you can follow the pattern of the existing Tornado connector (see `LlmTornado.VectorDatabases.PgVector`). The final code should compile and fully implement `IVectorDatabase` so that LlmTornado can use [vector database] for vector embeddings and search.
