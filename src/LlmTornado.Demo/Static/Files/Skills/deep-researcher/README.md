## Best Practices

### For Optimal Results

1. **Be specific about scope**: Clear research questions yield better focused results
2. **Indicate depth requirements**: Specify if you need high-level overview or deep technical detail
3. **Mention time constraints**: Helps balance thoroughness with timeliness
4. **Highlight priority areas**: Focus research effort on most important aspects
5. **Request specific formats**: Specify if you need executive summary, full report, comparison matrix, etc.

### Research Tips

- **Start broad, then narrow**: Initial exploration helps identify what's most important
- **Follow interesting threads**: Let compelling findings guide additional research
- **Question assumptions**: Challenge initial hypotheses with evidence
- **Document systematically**: Organized notes throughout enable better synthesis
- **Balance depth and breadth**: Know when to stop researching and start synthesizing

## Limitations

- **Public information only**: Cannot access proprietary databases or paywalled content
- **No real-time data**: Information is based on available sources, not live feeds
- **Language constraints**: Primarily English-language sources
- **No primary research**: Relies on existing published information, not original studies
- **Time-bound**: Very extensive research topics may need scoping to be manageable
