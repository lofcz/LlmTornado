        Create the structure of an evaluation that can be used to test a model's performance.
        An evaluation is a set of testing criteria and the config for a data source, which dictates the schema of the data used in the evaluation. After creating an evaluation, you can run it on different models and model parameters. We support several types of graders and datasources.
        For more information, see the [Evals guide](/docs/guides/evals).

        The Assistants API supports files up to 2 million tokens and of specific file types. See the [Assistants Tools guide](/docs/assistants/tools) for details.

        The Fine-tuning API only supports `.jsonl` files. The input also has certain required formats for fine-tuning [chat](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/chat-input) or [completions](/docs/api-reference/fine-tuning/completions-input) models.

        The Batch API only supports `.jsonl` files up to 200 MB in size. The input also has a specific required [format](/docs/api-reference/batch/request-input).

        Please [contact us](https://help.openai.com/) if you need to increase these storage limits.

    AssistantStreamEvent:
      description: |
        Represents an event emitted when streaming a Run.

        Each event in a server-sent events stream has an `event` and `data` property:

        ```
        event: thread.created
        data: {"id": "thread_123", "object": "thread", ...}
        ```

        We emit events whenever a new object is created, transitions to a new state, or is being
        streamed in parts (deltas). For example, we emit `thread.run.created` when a new run
        is created, `thread.run.completed` when a run completes, and so on. When an Assistant chooses
        to create a message during a run, we emit a `thread.message.created event`, a
        `thread.message.in_progress` event, many `thread.message.delta` events, and finally a
        `thread.message.completed` event.

        We may add additional events over time, so we recommend handling unknown events gracefully
        in your code. See the [Assistants API quickstart](/docs/assistants/overview) to learn how to
        integrate the Assistants API with streaming.

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_schema", "json_schema": {...} }` enables Structured Outputs which ensures the model will match your supplied JSON schema. Learn more in the [Structured Outputs guide](/docs/guides/structured-outputs).

        Setting to `{ "type": "json_object" }` enables JSON mode, which ensures the message the model generates is valid JSON.

        **Important:** when using JSON mode, you **must** also instruct the model to produce JSON yourself via a system or user message. Without this, the model may generate an unending stream of whitespace until the generation reaches the token limit, resulting in a long-running and seemingly "stuck" request. Also note that the message content may be partially cut off if `finish_reason="length"`, which indicates the generation exceeded `max_tokens` or the conversation exceeded the max context length.

            Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the GPT tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. You can use this [tokenizer tool](/tokenizer?view=bpe) to convert text to token IDs. Mathematically, the bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

            As an example, you can pass `{"50256": -100}` to prevent the <|endoftext|> token from being generated.

        Send this event to update the session’s default configuration.
        The client may send this event at any time to update any field,
        except for `voice`. However, note that once a session has been
        initialized with a particular `model`, it can’t be changed to
        another model using `session.update`.

        When the server receives a `session.update`, it will respond
        with a `session.updated` event showing the full, effective configuration.
        Only the fields that are present are updated. To clear a field like
        `instructions`, pass an empty string.

          - If set to 'auto', then the request will be processed with the service tier configured in the Project settings. Unless otherwise configured, the Project will use 'default'.
          - If set to 'default', then the requset will be processed with the standard pricing and performance for the selected model.
          - If set to '[flex](/docs/guides/flex-processing)' or 'priority', then the request will be processed with the corresponding service tier. [Contact sales](https://openai.com/contact-sales) to learn more about Priority processing.
          - When not set, the default behavior is 'auto'.

          When the `service_tier` parameter is set, the response body will include the `service_tier` value based on the processing mode actually used to serve the request. This response value may be different from the value set in the parameter.

            - **Built-in tools**: Tools that are provided by OpenAI that extend the
              model's capabilities, like [web search](/docs/guides/tools-web-search)
              or [file search](/docs/guides/tools-file-search). Learn more about
              [built-in tools](/docs/guides/tools).
            - **Function calls (custom tools)**: Functions that are defined by you,
              enabling the model to call your own code. Learn more about
              [function calling](/docs/guides/function-calling).

        Server VAD means that the model will detect the start and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech.
        Semantic VAD is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjuction with VAD) to semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then dynamically sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio trails off with "uhhm", the model will score a low probability of turn end and wait longer for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more natural conversations, but may have a higher latency.

      description: |
        Configuration for turn detection, ether Server VAD or Semantic VAD. This can be set to `null` to turn off, in which case the client must manually trigger model response.
        Server VAD means that the model will detect the start and end of speech based on audio volume and respond at the end of user speech.
        Semantic VAD is more advanced and uses a turn detection model (in conjuction with VAD) to semantically estimate whether the user has finished speaking, then dynamically sets a timeout based on this probability. For example, if user audio trails off with "uhhm", the model will score a low probability of turn end and wait longer for the user to continue speaking. This can be useful for more natural conversations, but may have a higher latency.

        silence_duration_ms: 1

      OpenAI's most advanced interface for generating model responses. Supports
      text and image inputs, and text outputs. Create stateful interactions
      with the model, using the output of previous responses as input. Extend
      the model's capabilities with built-in tools for file search, web search,
      computer use, and more. Allow the model access to external systems and data
      using function calling.

      When you [create a Response](/docs/api-reference/responses/create) with
      `stream` set to `true`, the server will emit server-sent events to the
      client as the Response is generated. This section contains the events that

      Programmatically manage your organization.
      The Audit Logs endpoint provides a log of all actions taken in the organization for security and monitoring purposes.
      To access these endpoints please generate an Admin API Key through the [API Platform Organization overview](/organization/admin-keys). Admin API keys cannot be used for non-administration endpoints.
      For best practices on setting up your organization, please refer to this [guide](/docs/guides/production-best-practices#setting-up-your-organization)

    title: Admin API Keys
    description: |
      Admin API keys enable Organization Owners to programmatically manage various aspects of their organization, including users, projects, and API keys. These keys provide administrative capabilities, such as creating, updating, and deleting users; managing projects; and overseeing API key lifecycles.

      Key Features of Admin API Keys:

      - User Management: Invite new users, update roles, and remove users from the organization.

      - Project Management: Create, update, archive projects, and manage user assignments within projects.

      - API Key Oversight: List, retrieve, and delete API keys associated with projects.

      Only Organization Owners have the authority to create and utilize Admin API keys. To manage these keys, Organization Owners can navigate to the Admin Keys section of their API Platform dashboard.

      For direct access to the Admin Keys management page, Organization Owners can use the following link:

      [https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/admin-keys](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/admin-keys)

      It's crucial to handle Admin API keys with care due to their elevated permissions. Adhering to best practices, such as regular key rotation and assigning appropriate permissions, enhances security and ensures proper governance within the organization.

    description: |
      The **Usage API** provides detailed insights into your activity across the OpenAI API. It also includes a separate [Costs endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs), which offers visibility into your spend, breaking down consumption by invoice line items and project IDs.

      While the Usage API delivers granular usage data, it may not always reconcile perfectly with the Costs due to minor differences in how usage and spend are recorded. For financial purposes, we recommend using the [Costs endpoint](/docs/api-reference/usage/costs) or the [Costs tab](/settings/organization/usage) in the Usage Dashboard, which will reconcile back to your billing invoice.
