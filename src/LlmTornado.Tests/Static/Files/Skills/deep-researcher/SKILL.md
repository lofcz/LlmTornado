```
Deep Research Progress:
- [ ] Step 1: Define research scope and objectives
- [ ] Step 2: Conduct initial exploratory research
- [ ] Step 3: Deep dive into key areas
- [ ] Step 4: Cross-reference and validate findings
- [ ] Step 5: Synthesize and analyze information
- [ ] Step 6: Generate structured research report
```

## **Step 1: Define research scope and objectives**

Clearly establish the research parameters:
- **Main research question**: What is the primary question or topic to investigate?
- **Scope boundaries**: What aspects should be included or excluded?
- **Depth requirements**: How detailed should the research be?
- **Expected deliverables**: What format and structure for the final output?
- **Key areas of focus**: What specific subtopics or angles to explore?

Document these parameters before proceeding to ensure focused and efficient research.

## **Step 2: Conduct initial exploratory research**

Begin with broad reconnaissance to map the landscape:
- **Search for overview information**: Use search tools to find general information, definitions, and context
- **Identify key sources**: Look for authoritative sources, recent publications, and expert opinions
- **Note initial findings**: Create a preliminary list of important concepts, terms, and themes
- **Discover related topics**: Identify adjacent areas that may be relevant
- **Assess information gaps**: Note what information is readily available vs. what needs deeper investigation

Create an initial research map with main themes and subtopics identified.

## **Step 3: Deep dive into key areas**

For each identified key area, conduct detailed investigation:
- **Targeted searches**: Use specific queries for each subtopic
- **Multiple perspectives**: Seek diverse viewpoints and approaches
- **Technical details**: Gather specific data, statistics, methodologies, or technical specifications
- **Historical context**: Understand the evolution and background
- **Current state**: Identify latest developments and trends
- **Future outlook**: Look for predictions, projections, or emerging patterns

Document findings systematically, noting sources and credibility indicators.

## **Step 4: Cross-reference and validate findings**

Ensure accuracy and reliability:
- **Verify key facts**: Cross-check important information across multiple sources
- **Identify contradictions**: Note where sources disagree and investigate why
- **Assess source credibility**: Evaluate the authority and reliability of information sources
- **Check recency**: Ensure information is current and relevant
- **Look for consensus**: Identify where experts or multiple sources agree
- **Flag uncertainties**: Mark areas where information is unclear or disputed

Create a validated knowledge base with confidence levels for different findings.

## **Step 5: Synthesize and analyze information**

Transform collected data into insights:
- **Identify patterns**: Look for common themes, trends, or relationships
- **Draw connections**: Link concepts across different sources and subtopics
- **Generate insights**: Develop original observations based on the research
- **Compare and contrast**: Analyze similarities and differences between approaches or perspectives
- **Evaluate implications**: Consider the significance and consequences of findings
- **Address the research question**: Directly answer the original question with evidence

Build a coherent narrative that goes beyond mere compilation of facts.

## **Step 6: Generate structured research report**

Create a comprehensive, well-organized final report:

### Report Structure:
1. **Executive Summary**
   - Brief overview of research question
   - Key findings (3-5 main points)
   - Main conclusions

2. **Introduction**
   - Research scope and objectives
   - Methodology overview
   - Key areas explored

3. **Main Body** (organized by themes/topics)
   - Detailed findings for each key area
   - Supporting evidence and examples
   - Multiple perspectives where relevant
   - Data and statistics

4. **Analysis & Synthesis**
   - Patterns and connections identified
   - Cross-cutting themes
   - Insights and interpretations
   - Implications of findings

5. **Conclusions**
   - Direct answers to research questions
   - Summary of most significant findings
   - Limitations of the research

6. **Sources & References**
   - List of key sources consulted
   - Credibility assessment where relevant

### Report Quality Standards:
- **Clarity**: Use clear, precise language
- **Structure**: Logical organization with clear headings
- **Evidence-based**: Support claims with specific references
- **Balanced**: Present multiple viewpoints fairly
- **Depth**: Go beyond surface-level information
- **Actionable**: Provide insights that can inform decisions or understanding

## Best Practices

### Research Strategies:
- **Iterative approach**: Refine research questions as understanding deepens
- **Breadth before depth**: Start broad, then narrow focus to important areas
- **Follow the thread**: Let interesting findings guide additional research paths
- **Document as you go**: Keep organized notes throughout the process
- **Question assumptions**: Challenge initial hypotheses with evidence

### Information Quality:
- **Prefer primary sources**: When possible, go to original sources rather than summaries
- **Recent is better**: Prioritize current information, especially for fast-moving topics
- **Multiple sources**: Don't rely on a single source for important facts
- **Expert opinion**: Seek out recognized authorities in the field
- **Data over anecdotes**: Prefer statistical evidence to individual stories

### Analysis Techniques:
- **SWOT analysis**: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats
- **Compare/Contrast**: Systematic comparison of different approaches or perspectives
- **Timeline analysis**: Understanding historical development and trends
- **Stakeholder analysis**: Identifying different perspectives and interests
- **Gap analysis**: Identifying what's missing or needs further research

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Confirmation bias**: Don't just look for information that supports initial assumptions
- **Information overload**: Know when enough research has been done
- **Outdated information**: Always check dates and currency of information
- **Single-source dependence**: Diversify sources to get complete picture
- **Analysis paralysis**: Balance thoroughness with timely completion
- **Losing focus**: Stay aligned with original research objectives

## Use Cases

This skill is ideal for:
- **Market research**: Understanding industries, competitors, or market trends
- **Technical investigation**: Deep dives into technologies, methodologies, or systems
- **Strategic planning**: Gathering intelligence for decision-making
- **Academic research**: Comprehensive literature reviews or topic exploration
- **Due diligence**: Thorough investigation before major decisions
- **Problem-solving**: Understanding complex problems before solution design
- **Trend analysis**: Identifying and understanding emerging patterns
- **Comparative analysis**: Evaluating multiple options or approaches
