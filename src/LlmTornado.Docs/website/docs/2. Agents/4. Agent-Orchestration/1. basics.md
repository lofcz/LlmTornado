# Agent Orchestration Basics

## Overview
# Power of the Orchestration Runtime Configuration
## Orchestration powered by State Machine architecture

## Inside the Orchestration Invoke

* Think of a `Orchestration` as a State Machine with strongly typed `TInput` and `TOutput` values for input validation
* Think of a `Runnable` as a state within a State Machine with strongly typed `TInput` and `TOutput` values for input validation
* Think of a `Advancer` as a state transition that has access to `TOutput` of the state to for conditional checks for Advancing to next 
`Runnable`
* Using the `Advancer` you can even add a Conversion Method as an input parameter to the transition to facilitate advancing to a Runnable with a invalid `TInput` (`TInput` != `TOutput`)

## Quick Start



## Best Practices

- Define clear handoff points between agents
- Maintain state across agent transitions
- Implement error handling at each stage
- Monitor orchestration progress
- Log agent interactions for debugging
